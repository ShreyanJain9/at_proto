## Installation

DON'T
<!--
Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add ATProto

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install ATProto -->

You will probably want to install it as a part of [Bskyrb](https://github.com/ShreyanJain9/bskyrb instead

You can also install the gem by cloning this repository and running `./install-local.sh`.
( I recommend using Bskyrb as those releases are more stable )


## Usage

TODO write docs

```ruby
require 'at_protocol'
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

 To release a new version, run `./deploy.sh` and you will be guided through updating the version number, bundling the gem, and pushing it to RubyGems. You must be signed in with a RubyGems account that has push access to this gem.

### Formatting

So nobody has to argue about formatting, bskyrb uses the `rufo` gem.

## Contributing

Please do!

### TODO
